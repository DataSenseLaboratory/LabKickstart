# LabKickstart
A repository to onboard new members into the lab environment. It includes tutorials, datasets, research tools, guidelines, and starter scripts to facilitate learning and collaboration.

**Welcome to the DataSense Lab!**  
The DataSense Lab focuses on the development and application of advanced techniques in data processing, feature extraction, machine learning, computer vision, and smart sensors. Our vision is to foster research, knowledge dissemination, and collaboration in areas such as fault diagnosis, life prediction, pattern recognition, and the implementation of sensor-based solutions for IoT, Industry 4.0, and biometrics.

## üîç Next Steps  

Once comfortable with the foundational skills, proceed to:  

1. **Explainable AI (XAI)**:  
   - Read *Why Should I Trust You? Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier* ([arXiv:1602.04938](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938)).  
   - Install and explore the [LIME library](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime).  
   - Complete the [Tabular Data Tutorial](https://marcotcr.github.io/lime/tutorials/Tutorial%20-%20continuous%20and%20categorical%20features.html).  

2. **Applied Projects**:  
   - Apply LIME to datasets relevant to your work, contributing to outcomes such as detection, classification, and attribute boundary extraction.
